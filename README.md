# INST-326-Final-Group-6
## Introduction ##
Jeopardy. One of the most influential and well known games of our generation. Everyone knows the classic tune which plays during Final Jeopardy. A game which tests the skills of some of the brightest and most educated people. The show has gone on for over 30 seasons. Our group wanted to build this project because we felt that it would be an interactive and impressive project that could be used in a variety of ways. 
## Choosing the Questions ## 
We wanted to include a wide variety of topics. Thus, that is why we chose our respective categories. These categories are Sports, Politics, Pop Culture, Technology, and Food. We chose these topics because we belive that they are relevant, interesting, and not too difficult to answer. We steered away from categories like Literature and History for that very reason. We chose questions which we believe were appropriately challenging. Questions we selected are all relatively recent.
